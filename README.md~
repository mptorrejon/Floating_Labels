# Floating_Labels
Angular.js .An interactive way of using floating labels with div contenteditable. 

This shows two different ways of how floating labels can be used. 
#1 when field is empty and label floats when user clicks on field
#2 when field is filled with previous data and needs to have a label to know what type of field it is. 

Im also implementing a way to select entire text or only edit a part of it.

I hope this helps anyone and if it does, make good of it.
